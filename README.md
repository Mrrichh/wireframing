# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation of a digital product, such as a website or mobile application. It serves as the blueprint of the design, outlining the structure, layout, and functionality without focusing on colors, typography, or final design details.

## Importance of Wireframing
- **Clarifies Structure**: Helps designers and developers understand the layout and flow of the interface.  
- **Encourages Collaboration**: Provides a simple way for teams and stakeholders to give feedback early in the design process.  
- **Saves Time and Cost**: Identifies usability issues and design flaws before moving into high-fidelity design and development.  
- **Improves User Experience**: Ensures that the product is intuitive and user-friendly by mapping out interactions beforehand.
